## NoSql Database

Nosql database is a non relational database used for storing data and relational values.It does not require a fix schema. It avoids joins and easy to sacale.
Nosql genarally also called no- SQL . It is genrally faster than our Relational databases.The major purpose of using NoSQL is to deal with large set of data.Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax to store and retrieve data for further insights. Instead, a NoSQL database system encompasses a wide range of database technologies that can store structured, semi-structured, unstructured and polymorphic data. 
## Brief History of NoSQL
    1998- Carlo Strozzi use the term NoSQL for his lightweight, open-source relational database
    2000- Graph database Neo4j is launched
    2004- Google BigTable is launched
    2005- CouchDB is launched
    2007- The research paper on Amazon Dynamo is released
    2008- Facebooks open sources the Cassandra project
    2009- The term NoSQL was reintroduced
## Why NoSQL ?
The concept of NoSQL became popular with company having trouble storing large data set and their scalability.The system response time becomes slow when you use RDBMS for massive volumes of data and in the woorld of data set storage of these large data aren't cost effective in relational database.These large set of data came in all shapes and sizes — structured, semi-structured, and polymorphic — and defining the schema in advance became nearly impossible. NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility than it counterparts.
## Some features of NoSQL
Some of the feature that NoSQL provide over RDBMS are
* Flexible
* Both horizontal and vertical scalibillity.
* Faster queries.
* Ease of use for developer.
* NoSQL databases never follow the relational model.
* Doesn’t require object-relational mapping and data normalization.
* Uses json file so data set does not have to follow schema.
